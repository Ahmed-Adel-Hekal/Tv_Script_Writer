# Tv_Script_Writer

This is a try of creat a program that generate semons script.<br />

# Code Overview 

Code contains important parts like :. <b>

1. Word embedding :<br>
   words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.<br>
   Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with many dimensions per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension.

2. Tokenize Punctuation : <br>
   RTokenizing and removing all punctuation marks from a sentence removes all punctuation marks from each word. <br>
   For example, the sentence "Think and wonder, wonder and think." tokenized and removed of punctuation marks is<br>
   ['Think', 'and', 'wonder', 'wonder', 'and', 'think'].efers to the calculation and storage of intermediate variables (including outputs) <br>
   for a neural network in order from the input layer to the output layer.
